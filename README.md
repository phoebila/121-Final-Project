# 121-Final-Project
This is the CMPM121 final project repository 

# Devlog Entry - [11/12/2024]
Initial Setup

## Introducing the team
Rozy Dixon - Tools\
Phoebe Royer - Design/Engine\
Jackson Mclane - Engine\
Jack Sims - Tools/Design\
James Milestone - Engine/Tools

## Tools and materials
  1.  The library we're using is phaser, since as a group we have more experience working with the phaser library from CMPM120. We also have some projects we had gotten inspired by to adapt to our final project.
  2.  We will be transferring from Javascript to TypeScript in Phaser, we believe that it has better interchangability and as a team we understand the syntax better. We also believe using Phaser will better achieve the project we wish to create, so the most experience we have is Javascript, and now through this class now TypeScript.
  3.  We will be using: Github, VSCode, Prettier, Lint, LiveServer, ChatGPT, Brace, Live Share, Discord Whiteboard, and Aesprite.
  4.  We're going to be using JavaScript to TypeScript for our final project. 

## Outlook
- We are hoping to create something publishable, and eventually host our project on itch.io.
- The hardest or riskiest part of the project is the impending shift from JavaScript to TypeScript.
- We are hoping to learn how to each specialize within respective responsibilities so that we can provide the greatest benefit to our team based on the roles we chose.
