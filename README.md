# Devlog Entry - [11/12/2024]
Initial Setup

## Introducing the team
Rozy Dixon - Tools
Phoebe Royer - Design/Engine
Jackson Mclane - Engine
Jack Sims - Tools/Design
James Milestone - Engine/Tools

## Tools and materials
  1.  The library we're using is phaser, since as a group we have more experience working with the phaser library from CMPM120. We also have some projects we had gotten inspired by to adapt to our final project.
  2.  Phaser Javascript to TypeScript, we believe that it has better interchangability and as a team we understand the syntax better. We also believe using Phaser will better achieve the project we wish to create, so the most experience we have is Javascript, and now through this class now TypeScript.
  3.  We will be using: Github, VSCode, Prettier, Lint, LiveServer, ChatGPT, Brace, Live Share, Discord Whiteboard, and Aesprite.
  4.  We're going to be using JavaScript to TypeScript for our final project. 

## Outlook
We're hoping to create the best game ever and make a million dollars. We want to replace Brace with our game.
